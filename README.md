# VBA-Extractor

This is my code to extract emails into workbooks for text mining.

The Extract1 macro extracts emails from your Outlook inbox or sub-folder into a spreadsheet, bccs included. (If you're doing this just for yourself, Power Query is easier: https://www.xelplus.com/import-outlook-to-excel-with-power-query/) 

Assuming you've run Extract1 for many people, the Extract2 macro then extracts their spreadsheets into individual tabs on the workbook. You only need to put them all in the same Desktop folder beforehand.

To use this code, you'll need to go into the Visual Basic Developer in Excel using Alt-F11. The notes explain the code and give instructions for what you need to update your file path.

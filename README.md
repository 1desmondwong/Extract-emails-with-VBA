# VBA-Extractor

This is my code to extract emails into a workbook for text mining.

The Extract1 macro extracts emails from your Outlook inbox or sub-folder into a spreadsheet, bccs included. (Another option would be Power Query: https://www.xelplus.com/import-outlook-to-excel-with-power-query/) 

Assuming you've run Extract1 for many people, the Extract2 macro then extracts their spreadsheets into individual tabs on the workbook. This happens after the spreadsheets have been deposited in a folder on your computer.

To use this code, go into the workbook's Visual Basic Developer using Alt-F11. In my notes, I explain how to update your file paths and how the code works.
